        <p class="content-text">Melaka is a state in Malaysia located in the southern region of the Malay Peninsula,
            next to the Strait of Malacca. Its capital is Malacca City, dubbed the Historic City,[13] which has been
            listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 7 July 2008.[14]
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">The state is bordered by Negeri Sembilan to the north and west and Johor to the south.
            The exclave of Tanjung Tuan also borders Negeri Sembilan to the north. Its capital Malacca City is 148
            kilometres (92 miles) southeast of Malaysia's capital city Kuala Lumpur, 235 kilometres (146 miles)
            northwest of Johor's largest city Johor Bahru and 95 km (59 miles) northwest of Johor's second largest city,
            Batu Pahat.

            Although it was the location of one of the earliest Malay sultanates, namely the Malacca Sultanate, the
            local monarchy was abolished when the Portuguese conquered it in 1511. The head of state is the Yang
            di-Pertua Negeri or Governor, rather than a Sultan. Malacca is noted for its unique history and it is one of
            the major tourist destinations in Malaysia. With a highly strategic state position for international trade
            routes, Malacca was once a well-known international trade centre in the East.
