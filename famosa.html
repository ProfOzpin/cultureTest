            Velha Portuguese: the old fortress, and Dutch: Slavenburgh (slave castle) & De Misericorde (Our Lady of
            Mercy, from French: Notre Dame de Miséricorde)[1] was a Portuguese fortress built in Malacca, Malaysia, in
            1512. The oldest part of the fortress was a five-storey keep which gave its name to the fortress as a
            whole.[2] Some time following the Battle of Malacca (1641) and the occupation of the city by the Dutch, the
            keep was destroyed but the outer walls of the fortress were reinforced. However, in 1807 the British
            destroyed most of the fortress. The Porta de Santiago gateway, and the restored Middelburg Bastion, are the
            only parts of the fortress that remain today. They are among the oldest European architectural remains in
            Southeast Asia and the Far East.
